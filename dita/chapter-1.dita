    <title>Meet Rapunzel</title>
    <body>
        <p audience="adult">Rapunzel is a young woman who lives in isolation in a tower, with long
            blonde hair that glows when she sings. The only other person she sees is her guardian,
            Mother Gothel, who keeps her hidden for reasons unknown to Rapunzel. On her 18th
            birthday, Rapunzel starts asking questions about her life and the world outside of the
            tower which leads her to become suspicious of her "mother." </p>
        <p audience="children">Rapunzel lives in a tal, shimmering, hidden tower with her mother.
            She has magnificent hair that shines like gold with a magical glow. Every night she
            watches glowing laterns float past her window and she dreams of seeing them up close.
            She's not sure why her mother won't let her leave the tower, but she has a feeling
            something exciting is waiting for her. </p>
